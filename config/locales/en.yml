      question1: "Which English language level should I choose?"
      question2: "How is my test result calculated?"
      question3: "How much time do I need to finish the test?"
      answer1: "Check the English language descriptors or take our free
        English placement test (pre-test), a  quick 10-min adaptive English
        grammar test. It will give you a recommendation which level you should
        start with.  You also get an instant feedback how successful you are
        after each testing block so you can change the level during the test if
        you feel it is too easy or difficult."
      answer2: "Your result is a percentage rate from all your successfully
        answered questions"
      answer3: "TrackTest English test for individuals does not have a time
        limit so you can take it without time pressure. If you belong to the
        specific company or school account, you might be required to complete
        the test before the specific time."
