        English placement test (pre-test), a  quick 10-min adaptive English
        grammar test. It will give you a recommendation which level you should
        start with.  You also get an instant feedback how successful you are
        after each testing block so you can change the level during the test if
        you feel it is too easy or difficult."

        answered questions"
